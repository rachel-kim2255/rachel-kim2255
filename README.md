## 🛒 [SQL/Python] E-commerce Customer Behavior & RFM Segmentation  
**🛠️ SQLite, Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)**  
📎 Rachel Kim  
📅 Date: 2025.07 – 2025.09 (Completed)  
📚 Individual Project  

This project analyzes customer behavior in a Brazilian e-commerce marketplace using SQL and Python, with a focus on **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation**. The analysis identifies high-value and at-risk customers, evaluates revenue concentration, and proposes actionable strategies such as **VIP retention, reactivation campaigns, and upselling opportunities**.

## 💬 [Text Analysis] User Pain Point Analysis for Caregiver Hiring MVP Development  
**🛠 Python (PRAW, pandas, text analysis)**  
📎 Rachel Kim  
📅 Date: 2025.08 (Completed - 2025.08.05)  
📚 Hackathon Project  
🏆 2nd Place Winner at the KATEC Idea Market Hackathon  

As part of an early-stage MVP ideation for a caregiver hiring platform, this project explores Reddit discussions related to caregiving to uncover key user pain points, unmet needs, and regional demand patterns. Using web scraping and text analysis techniques, I collected and analyzed posts from both caregiver-focused subreddits and Canada-specific communities. The goal was to extract raw, unfiltered insights to guide product direction and validate market needs for CareCarry, a caregiver hiring and tax compliance platform. Key methods include keyword filtering, sentiment analysis, and regional segmentation.
