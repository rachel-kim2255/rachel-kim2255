📚 Hackathon Project   
🏆 2nd Place Winner at the KATEC Idea Market Hackathon  
<br>
As part of an early-stage MVP ideation for a caregiver hiring platform, this project explores Reddit discussions related to caregiving to uncover key user pain points, unmet needs, and regional demand patterns.

Using web scraping and text analysis techniques, I collected and analyzed posts from both caregiver-focused subreddits and Canada-specific communities. The goal was to extract raw, unfiltered insights to guide product direction and validate market needs for CareCarry, a caregiver hiring and tax compliance platform. Key methods include keyword filtering, sentiment analysis, and regional segmentation.
